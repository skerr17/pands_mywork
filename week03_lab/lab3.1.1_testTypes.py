# Create 5 variables of different types and print them to the console
# int, float, boolean, str, list, use the type() function to check the type of the variables.

# variable 1 is type class = 'int' and value = 3
i = 3
print(f'The value of i = {i}')
print(f'The class type of i = {type(i)}\n')

# variable 2 is type class = 'float' and value = 3.5
fl = 3.5
print(f'The value of ifl = {fl}')
print(f'The class type of fl = {type(fl)}\n')

# variable 3 is type class = 'boolean' and value = True
is_ = True
print(f'The value of is = {is_}')
print(f'The class type of is = {type(is_)}\n')

# variable 4 is type class = 'str' and value =  'how now Brown Cow'
memo = "how now Brown Cow"
print(f'The value of memo = {memo}')
print(f'The class type of memo = {type(memo)}\n')

# variable 5 is type class = 'list' and value =  '[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]'
lots = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
